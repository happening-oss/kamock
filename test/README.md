# Unit tests?

Yes; three reasons:

1. The mock broker's kinda complicated in places. It's good if it doesn't get broken.
2. It serves to check that the examples actually work.
3. As further examples to demonstrate how to use the mock broker.

## Aren't you just replicating a bunch of the code from kafine?

Yes.
